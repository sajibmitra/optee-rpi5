NVIDIA Tegra
============

-  .. rubric:: T194
      :name: t194

T194 has eight NVIDIA Carmel CPU cores in a coherent multi-processor
configuration. The Carmel cores support the ARM Architecture version 8.2,
executing both 64-bit AArch64 code, and 32-bit AArch32 code. The Carmel
processors are organized as four dual-core clusters, where each cluster has
a dedicated 2 MiB Level-2 unified cache. A high speed coherency fabric connects
these processor complexes and allows heterogeneous multi-processing with all
eight cores if required.

Directory structure
-------------------

-  plat/nvidia/tegra/common - Common code for all Tegra SoCs
-  plat/nvidia/tegra/soc/txxx - Chip specific code

Trusted OS dispatcher
---------------------

Tegra supports multiple Trusted OS'.

- Trusted Little Kernel (TLK): In order to include the 'tlkd' dispatcher in
  the image, pass 'SPD=tlkd' on the command line while preparing a bl31 image.
- Trusty: In order to include the 'trusty' dispatcher in the image, pass
  'SPD=trusty' on the command line while preparing a bl31 image.

This allows other Trusted OS vendors to use the upstream code and include
their dispatchers in the image without changing any makefiles.

These are the supported Trusted OS' by Tegra platforms.

- Tegra194: Trusty

Scatter files
-------------

Tegra platforms currently support scatter files and ld.S scripts. The scatter
files help support ARMLINK linker to generate BL31 binaries. For now, there
exists a common scatter file, plat/nvidia/tegra/scat/bl31.scat, for all Tegra
SoCs. The `LINKER` build variable needs to point to the ARMLINK binary for
the scatter file to be used. Tegra platforms have verified BL31 image generation
with ARMCLANG (compilation) and ARMLINK (linking) for the Tegra186 platforms.

Preparing the BL31 image to run on Tegra SoCs
---------------------------------------------

.. code:: shell

    CROSS_COMPILE=<path-to-aarch64-gcc>/bin/aarch64-none-elf- make PLAT=tegra \
    TARGET_SOC=<target-soc e.g. t194> SPD=<dispatcher e.g. trusty|tlkd>
    bl31

Note that all Tegra platforms only support compiling with GCC or ARMCLANG. Clang
is not supported. Images will compile with clang, but will not boot.

Platforms wanting to use different TZDRAM\_BASE, can add ``TZDRAM_BASE=<value>``
to the build command line.

The Tegra platform code expects a pointer to the following platform specific
structure via 'x1' register from the BL2 layer which is used by the
bl31\_early\_platform\_setup() handler to extract the TZDRAM carveout base and
size for loading the Trusted OS and the UART port ID to be used. The Tegra
memory controller driver programs this base/size in order to restrict NS
accesses.

typedef struct plat\_params\_from\_bl2 {
/\* TZ memory size */
uint64\_t tzdram\_size;
/* TZ memory base */
uint64\_t tzdram\_base;
/* UART port ID \*/
int uart\_id;
/* L2 ECC parity protection disable flag \*/
int l2\_ecc\_parity\_prot\_dis;
/* SHMEM base address for storing the boot logs \*/
uint64\_t boot\_profiler\_shmem\_base;
} plat\_params\_from\_bl2\_t;

Power Management
----------------

The PSCI implementation expects each platform to expose the 'power state'
parameter to be used during the 'SYSTEM SUSPEND' call. The state-id field
is implementation defined on Tegra SoCs and is preferably defined by
tegra\_def.h.

Tegra configs
-------------

-  'tegra\_enable\_l2\_ecc\_parity\_prot': This flag enables the L2 ECC and Parity
   Protection bit, for Arm Cortex-A57 CPUs, during CPU boot. This flag will
   be enabled by Tegrs SoCs during 'Cluster power up' or 'System Suspend' exit.
